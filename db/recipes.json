      "8) Remove the moulds and let them rest for 2–3 minutes. Then unmould the idlis using a wet spoon.",
      "9) Serve hot with coconut chutney, sambar, or milagai podi."

      "3) In the same oil, add 0.5 tsp mustard seeds. When they start to pop, add curry leaves and green chilies. Sauté for 15–20 seconds until fragrant.",
      "4) Add the chopped onions and cook for 3–4 minutes until they turn translucent (not browned).",
      "5) Add the softened poha mixture and gently toss everything together using a flat spatula. Add roasted peanuts back in. Mix well but avoid breaking the poha flakes.",
      "6) Cover and steam on low heat for 2–3 minutes. This allows the flavors to combine and the poha to become fluffy.",
      "7) Turn off the heat. Add lemon juice and chopped coriander. Mix lightly.",
      "8) Garnish with grated coconut (optional) and serve hot immediately with extra lemon wedges and a cup of hot chai."

      }
    ],
    "steps": [
      "1) Make the masala from scratch (optional but recommended): In a small dry pan on medium heat, toast 1 tbsp coriander seeds, 1 tsp cumin seeds, 1/2 tsp fennel seeds, 4–5 black peppercorns, 3 dried red chilies, 1/2 inch cinnamon stick, 2 cloves and 1 bay leaf for 2–3 minutes until fragrant. Cool, then grind to a fine powder. Mix in 1 tsp amchur (dry mango powder) if using. Store — this yields about 2–3 tbsp of fresh masala.",
      "2) Prep vegetables: Peel and roughly chop potatoes and carrot. Break cauliflower into small florets. Finely chop 1 onion for bhaji and thinly slice the other (for faster cooking you can keep both chopped). Roughly chop tomatoes. Crush garlic and grate or finely chop ginger. Finely chop coriander and slit the green chili.",
      "3) Par-cook root vegetables: In a pressure cooker or large pot, add potatoes, cauliflower, carrot and peas with 1/2 tsp salt and enough water to cover. Cook until soft (2 whistles in a cooker or 12–15 minutes simmer). Drain and reserve the cooking liquid. Coarsely mash the cooked vegetables with a potato masher — leave it slightly coarse (not fully smooth).",
      "4) Cook the bhaji base: In a heavy-bottomed pan or kadhai, heat 2 tbsp butter + 1 tbsp oil on medium heat (oil prevents butter from burning). Add 0.5 tsp cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds. Add the finely chopped onion and sauté until translucent and beginning to brown (6–8 minutes).",
      "5) Add aromatics and tomatoes: Add crushed garlic, chopped ginger and slit green chili. Sauté 1–2 minutes until raw smell goes. Add the chopped tomatoes and a pinch of salt; cook until tomatoes are soft and oil starts to separate (8–10 minutes). You can mash tomatoes with the back of a spoon while cooking.",
      "6) Spice it: Add 1–2 tsp of the freshly ground pav bhaji masala (or 2 tbsp if using store-bought), 1 tsp red chilli powder, 1 tsp coriander powder and 1/4 tsp turmeric. Cook the spices with the tomato-onion mixture for 1–2 minutes so the raw spice taste disappears.",
      "7) Combine vegetables and simmer: Add the mashed vegetables to the pan. Mix thoroughly. Add 1 cup of reserved cooking liquid (or water) to loosen the mixture. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat and simmer, mashing the mixture against the side of the pan with a masher to make a smooth-but-textured gravy. Add salt to taste.",
      "8) Finish with butter and adjust: Add remaining 2 tbsp butter and 1 tsp kasuri methi (crushed) if using. Simmer on low for 8–10 minutes, stirring and mashing occasionally. If bhaji is too thick, add a little hot water. Taste and adjust spices, salt and lemon.",
      "9) Toast the pav: Heat a flat tawa or skillet. Slice pav horizontally (not all the way through). Add a knob of butter and place pav on tawa cut-side down, press lightly and toast until golden and crisp on both sides. For extra flavor, sprinkle a tiny pinch of pav bhaji masala on the butter before toasting.",
      "10) Serve: Transfer bhaji to a serving bowl, garnish generously with chopped coriander and a knob of butter on top. Serve hot with toasted buttered pav, lemon wedges and finely chopped onions on the side.",
      "11) Vegan option: Replace butter with vegan butter or extra oil. Reduce or omit kasuri methi if unavailable.",
      "12) Storage & reheating: Store bhaji in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat on low with a splash of water and a pat of butter or oil to restore richness.",
      "13) Scaling: This recipe scales well — double quantities for a larger crowd. If using store-bought pav bhaji masala, start with 2 tbsp and adjust to taste."
